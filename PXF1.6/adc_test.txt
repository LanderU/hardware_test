TEST
====

To make a simple test, using commands follow this:

- Enable driver
echo cape-bone-iio > /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots

- Read values
cat /sys/devices/ocp.2/helper.11/AIN1

PXF ADCs:
ADC2 -> AIN3 -> P9_38
ADC1 -> AIN2 -> P9_37

Connector pins:
1.- 5V
2.- ADC2
3.- GND
4.- ADC1
5.- GND

Test procedure
==============

1.- Test of the BBB pins using pins:
 
- P9.34 -> GND_ADC
- P9.32 -> VDD_ADC

- p9.38 -> AIN3
- P9:37 -> AIN2

Works fine, but I have noticed that the voltage increase/drop is mirrowed in the contiguous channels

2.- Test of the AIN2 and AIN3. To do so, a potentiometer has been used. The potentiometer is connected to 5v and 0V
provided by the ADC connector. Then, the value of 5kohm nominal potentiometer has been changed in ranges between 0~5v.

With this values, 1799 points (0v) and 555 points (5.3v) has been reviwed. Adelta= 1799-555= 1244 points for 5.3v.
Notice that the connector channels is not strightly connected to the ADC channel. The PXF has internally a voltage
divisor made by resistors.
